# Progress

Resume point for the build. Update after every milestone and before any context reset.

## Milestone state

| Milestone | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| M0 Foundation and setup | DONE (2026-09-25) | App runs, local PostgreSQL bootstrapped, 5 migrations + local auth shim applied, seeded accounts/orgs/sites, sign-in verified over HTTP, unauthorized site read returns 404 with no data. |
| M1 First complete publishing workflow | DONE (2026-09-26) | Edit → draft → approve → frozen candidate → preview → atomic activation → public demo route, verified by 28 unit, 21 integration and 2 browser tests. |
| M2 Complete editing and public experiences | DONE (2026-09-26) | All six content kinds editable and rendered; media pipeline with validation and derivatives; two fully populated fictional pilots with original generated artwork; search/filters; settings; site creation; responsive screenshots at 390/768/1440 with no overflow; 28 unit, 25 integration, 6 browser tests. |
| M3 Operational completion | IN PROGRESS | |
| M4 Verification and refinement | NOT STARTED | |

## Environment blockers (precise)

- **No container runtime**: Docker client present, daemon absent (`/var/run/docker.sock`
  missing). `supabase start` cannot run. Mitigation: local PostgreSQL 16 server + local auth
  shim (see `docs/DECISIONS.md` D-002). Supabase Auth/Storage adapters are unverified here.
- **Supabase CLI** not installable: GitHub release downloads are denied by the egress proxy.
- Hosted services (Vercel, Supabase project, transactional email) are not configured; no
  account or credential exists in this environment. Nothing was faked.

## Last verified results

- 2026-09-26 (M2) `pnpm test` 28 passed; `pnpm test:integration` 25 passed (adds media
  validation); `pnpm test:e2e` 6 passed (publishing loop, access denial, directory filters and
  search, events/hours truthfulness, public inquiry form to inbox, upload rejection/acceptance).
  Responsive screenshot pass (15 public pages × 390/768/1440 plus dashboard screens) reported
  no horizontal overflow and no console errors: `docs/evidence/screenshots/*-{390,768,1440}.png`.
- 2026-09-26 (M1) `pnpm test` 28 passed; `pnpm test:integration` 21 passed (isolation, publishing
  integrity, inquiries); `pnpm test:e2e` 2 passed (full publishing loop; access denial).
  `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` clean. Browser evidence: `docs/evidence/screenshots/m1-*.png`.
- 2026-09-25 `pnpm db:start`, `pnpm db:migrate` (6 migrations + shim), `pnpm seed:demo`,
  `pnpm typecheck` all succeed.
- 2026-09-25 HTTP checks against `next dev`: `/app` without session → 307 to `/sign-in`;
  owner session → 200 listing both organizations; editor A → 404 for organization B's site,
  200 for site A with only Content/Reviews navigation.
- psql boundary probes: app role without context denied; anon denied on tables, allowed on
  `get_demo_release`; authenticated stranger sees 0 rows and cannot create organizations.

## Current task

M3: access management and invitations (local mail sink), notification worker and delivery
queue, CSV import with dry run, portable site package export/import, audit trail view,
backup/restore rehearsal, `pnpm verify`.

## Next action

Implement `src/server/inquiries/worker.ts` + `scripts/worker.ts`, then Access management,
then import/export.

## Usage

Actual Claude Code usage is not visible from inside the session; the owner should read it
from their usage dashboard at each milestone. No estimate is recorded here.
